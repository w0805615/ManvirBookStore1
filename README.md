# ManvirBookStore1
This is the project that I created in the St. Clair College.
I started this project on 2023-03-02
Produced a fictional company named ManvirBookStore to promote the books. 
Documented the attributes of the object and reviewed the architecture of a robust MVC web application to generate a product catalogue allowing for CRUD operations. 
Created an ASP.NET Core 3.1 application with the assigned product using Visual Studio 2019. 
Didn't placed the solution file and project in the same folder.
Included Individual User Accounts authentication and configured for HTTPS.
Completed this project on 2023-04-20
